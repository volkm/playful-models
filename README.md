# Playful probabilistic models

A collection of interesting riddles and scenarios which can be modelled by probabilistic models.
The collection aims to provide small and intuitive examples which provide interesting insights.
These models show the range of results and insights one can obtain from analysis via probabilistic model checking.

The collection of examples includes:
- the [birthday paradox](birthday_paradox)
- the riddle of the [prisoners with a light bulb](prisoners_lightbulb)
- a [queueing systems with different number of tellers](queuing_system_teller)
